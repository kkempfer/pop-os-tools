# AM5 AMD Linux (Pop!\_OS) Desktop

## Description

As a Linux user, I am commited to support AMD. I opted for the AM5 socket for long-term support. Since my needs and the games I play are not too demanding, I prioritized reliable base components over investing heavily in the GPU, leaving room for future upgrades.

My budget was around $1500 CAD. I gathered the parts over several weeks to find the best deals possible.

Key components:

* CPU: I opted for a reliable and powerful AM5 CPU that meets my needs. The integrated Radeon graphics could come in handy one day for debugging purposes.
* CPU cooler: I went with ARCTIC cooling solutions for their quality and affordability.
* Motherboard: I selected a quality motherboard with extensive IO and integrated Wi-Fi. However, I encountered two significant issues: screen freezing with XMP/EXPO enabled and Bluetooth occasionally turning off and locking after boot. A firmware update (version 7D75v172 2023-06-30) resolved the Bluetooth issue. I did not investigate further the XMP/EXPO system stability issue yet. The MSI customer service could be improved. On another note, this motherboard comes with 2 PCIE x16 slots. In the future, I may install a second GPU (Sapphire AMD Radeon RX 7600 XT 16GB) to do some experiments with GPU passthrough technology.
* Memory: I chose AMD EXPO low-profile RAM.
* Storage: Fast !
* GPU: I opted for a GPU that seamlessly works with Linux. Check Wendell's review on the [Level1Linux YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0kM-c0pEak).
* Case: Excellent build quality.
* Power supply: I chose the Thermaltake Toughpower GF3, a top-tier PSU recommended by the Cultists network. The extra wattage leaves room for future upgrades. It was purchased during a sale.
* Case fans: I replaced the three DC stock fans by ARCTIC PWM fans for better performance.
* OS: I selected [Pop!\_OS](https://pop.system76.com/), a variant of Ubuntu, to try something a bit different. It has a clean, user-friendly interface.
